## Business Task
The Olympics comprises all the Games from Athens 1986 to Rio 2016. The Olympics is more than just a quadrennial multi-sport world championship. It is a lense through which to understand global history, including shifting geopolitical power dynamics, womenâ€™s empowerment, and the evolving values of society. 

Through this dataset, we want to gain insights into the performance of different countries and athletes in the Olympics, and understand trends and patterns in medal distribution by sport and gender.
